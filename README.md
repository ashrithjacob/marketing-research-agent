# marketing-research-agent

The researcher, and the cockpit you watch it from. Live at
**https://marketing.vanis.ai**.

Stage 1 of five is built. The rest is specified and not written.

## Read in this order

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `spec.md` | the researcher — what the compartment produces and why it is trustworthy |
| `spec-stage-1.md` | **stage 1**: the run contract, the four nodes, and how a packet is refused |
| `spec-review-mining.md` | **review mining**: what Amazon and Trustpilot actually cost and refuse, measured |
| `cockpit-spec.md` | how you watch it. §6 is superseded and says why |
| `cockpit-demo/` | the scripted UI demo of all five stages; still the clearest picture of where this goes |

The two PDFs are the sources: the compartment framework, and the book-to-skill
packaging method.

## The one idea

Stage 1 gathers raw material and **draws no conclusions**. `spec.md` names
concluding-while-collecting as the single most common failure in this
framework, so rather than instructing the agent not to:

> **The stage-1 output schema has no field a conclusion could be written into.**

No `claim`, no `finding`, no `summary`; `.strict()` on every object. An agent
that writes `"finding": …` gets a hard rejection naming the field and the run
ends `invalid` — a status kept distinct from `failed` because *the agent
finished and produced something wrong* is the most informative failure there is.

Three things are allowed, because they are transcription rather than judgement:
an **excerpt** (a verbatim span), a **measurement** (a number a source states),
and an **attribute** (a field read off a page). The test is: *if a second person
with the same source would write down a different value, it is a judgement.*

## Why it is its own service

`cockpit-spec.md` §6 first said this would be a tab in agentchat. It is not, and
the reversal is the more useful record:

**The researcher's entire input is fetched from the open web, and a fetched page
can contain instructions.** Sharing agentchat's process meant sharing a database
with an agent whose input is attacker-influenceable; sharing one hermes gateway
meant sharing `state.db`, long-term memory, sessions and the skills directory
with it too. So it gets its own everything, as its own stack.

The duller argument is just as real: a research run is measured in hours and a
chat deploy in minutes. Coupled, every UI tweak risks a running job.

**Superseded:** that used to mean *its own hermes container*, and it no longer
does. The harness runs inside this service now (`@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`,
in-process), so there is no second gateway to isolate against. The isolation
argument survives intact and is met more cheaply: the agent is handed exactly
two tools, `web_search` and `web_fetch`, and neither can run a command, read a
file, or reach another agent's memory. A poisoned page's best case is lying to
the packet, and the packet is validated.

That is a narrowing, not a loss. Under hermes the agent's web access depended on
which backend the harness had auto-detected, and the first live run fell back to
driving a browser because `ddgs` was missing on the VPS — a failure that looked
like an idle run. Two functions in this repo behave the same way on every
machine.

## Layout

```
docker-compose.yaml   the whole stack, one file: cockpit and search —
                       `docker compose up` and done
searxng/settings.yml  the one override SearXNG needs (JSON output is off by
                       default) — see the file for why
server/src/
  settings.ts     every env var, MRA_-prefixed (plus APIFY_TOKEN)
  schema.ts       the run contract; .strict() is the guarantee, not tidiness
  packet.ts       find the JSON in the output (forgiving), then validate (not)
  prompt.ts       brief + admission policy + judgements -> instructions
  tools.ts        web_search (SearXNG) + web_fetch (Firecrawl, auto-archiving)
                  + the three Apify review tools
  apify.ts        the Apify boundary: Amazon + Trustpilot reviews, and costs
  http.ts         fetch-with-deadline and a bounded concurrency pool
  store.ts        ResearchStore interface + SqliteResearchStore
  runner.ts       RunSupervisor — one pi Agent per run, owns its event stream
  api.ts          /api/research/*
  app.ts          auth + routes + the built SPA
  main.ts         process entry: recover, then serve
server/tests/     vitest; most of it is about what the validator refuses
frontend/src/     React 18 + Vite, no UI framework
deploy/           Caddy snippet for marketing.vanis.ai; vps/ holds the
                  production compose, deploy.sh, change-password.sh and
                  mra-snapshot.sh
```

The engine is `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, embedded in this process rather
than called over HTTP. `runner.ts` builds one `Agent` per run, subscribes to its
events, and writes every one to SQLite before fanning it out — so a browser
refresh replays the run instead of losing it.

## Run it

One file, one command. Everything is containerised, so none of it has to be up
when you are not using it.

### First time

```bash
cd marketing-research-agent
cp .env.example .env
```

Four values go in `.env`. Two are secrets you generate, two are API keys you
paste:

```bash
# generate these two
openssl rand -hex 32    # -> MRA_JWT_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32    # -> SEARXNG_SECRET
```

| Key | Where from |
|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | https://openrouter.ai/keys — inference |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys — page fetching, free tier |

A fourth is optional:

| Key | Where from |
|---|---|
| `APIFY_TOKEN` | https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations — **review mining only** |

Leave it blank and everything else works; the three review tools are withheld
from the agent and `review_mining` is gapped with a reason. Set it and read the
cost note in `.env.example` first — Apify bills per *event* against a real card
with no allowance, and the FREE plan stops at $5/month.

`.env` is gitignored and should stay that way. `chmod 600 .env` is worth doing.
Note that `docker compose config` prints every resolved value, secrets included
— don't paste its output anywhere.

### Start it

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
open http://localhost:8080
```

First `up` pulls ~100 MB for SearXNG and builds the cockpit image, which
compiles `better-sqlite3` from source on alpine — a couple of minutes, once.

### Check it came up clean

Two things, because one of them fails quietly:

```bash
# 1. searxng and mra should both be Up.
docker compose ps

# 2. Should return JSON, not HTML and not a 403.
docker compose exec mra node -e \
  "fetch('http://searxng:8080/search?q=test&format=json').then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>console.log(t.slice(0,200)))"
```

Check 2 is the one worth doing: SearXNG ships with JSON output **disabled**, and
`searxng/settings.yml` is what turns it on. If that mount ever fails, every
`web_search` call throws on a 403 — loudly, which is the point, but the message
names SearXNG rather than the config file that caused it.

### Stop it

```bash
docker compose down      # volumes keep your runs and the corpus
```

`docker compose down -v` also deletes the volumes — your run history and every
archived page. Rarely what you want.

### Review mining, locally

The three review tools need one key and nothing else — no container, no SearXNG,
no Trustpilot browser. Put `APIFY_TOKEN` in `.env`, then:

```bash
cd server && npm install            # apify-client is a dependency now

# 1. Does the app think it is configured?
set -a; . ../.env; set +a
node -e 'process.env.APIFY_TOKEN ? console.log("token present") : process.exit(1)'

# 2. Hit the actors directly, outside the app, with a spend cap.
#    ~$0.06 a run. Overridable: SPIKE_URL, SPIKE_STARS, SPIKE_MAX.
node scripts/apify-spike.mjs amazon
node scripts/apify-spike.mjs trustpilot

# 3. Through the real tools, which also writes to the corpus.
docker compose up -d --build
curl -s localhost:8080/api/research/config | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A2 review_mining
```

`review_mining.configured: false` means the tools are not on the agent's
surface at all — check `APIFY_TOKEN` reached the process, not the run.

**Every call costs money and there is no allowance.** Guardrails already in the
code, worth knowing before changing them:

- Each call carries a `maxTotalChargeUsd` sized from the volume requested
  (`capFor` in `src/apify.ts`). The actor's *stated minimum* is not a sufficient
  cap — a $0.005 cap on the search actor is accepted and then kills the run with
  "Charge limit has already been reached", returning an empty dataset that reads
  as "no products found". That cost an afternoon; the test is in `apify.test.ts`.
- `MRA_APIFY_MAX_REVIEWS` (default 10) bounds each call. On the FREE plan the
  Amazon actor caps at **1 start URL and 10 reviews per run** anyway, says so
  only in its run log, and silently drops the extras.
- Check spend with `client.user('me').limits()` — the FREE ceiling is $5/month.
  `usageTotalUsd` is **not** populated on the object `.call()` returns; read it
  back from `client.run(id).get()` a moment later or every run looks free.

**Two results are not failures.** `no_relevant_reviews_found` means ratings exist
but nobody wrote text at that star band — common, and the honest answer in a thin
category. An empty dataset on a finished run means the *lookup* failed. Both
become gaps; neither is "this product has no reviews".

### When something breaks

```bash
docker compose logs -f            # everything, live
docker compose logs mra           # just the cockpit and the agent
docker compose up -d --build mra  # rebuild just the cockpit after a code change
```

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Every `web_search` fails with a 403 | SearXNG JSON disabled — the `searxng/settings.yml` mount failed (check 2 above) |
| Every `web_fetch` fails | `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` unset or out of quota; the error names Firecrawl and the status |
| A run says `failed` with "the server restarted" | exactly what it says — the agent runs in this process, so a rebuild or restart kills a run in flight |
| Login succeeds then immediately logs out | `MRA_COOKIE_SECURE=true` over plain `http://localhost`; `.env.example` sets it false for this reason |
| Cockpit unreachable | the stack is on-demand — `docker compose ps`, then `up -d` |
| Runs fail immediately with "unknown model" | `MRA_MODEL` is not an OpenRouter model id |
| Every source comes back `archived: false` | the `corpus` volume is not mounted; `GET /api/research/config` reports `corpus_mounted` |
| Review mining finds nothing at all | `APIFY_TOKEN` blank, so the tools are not on the agent's surface. `GET /api/research/config` reports `review_mining.configured` |
| Review tools stop mid-run with a billing error | Apify 402 — out of credit, not an absence of reviews. FREE plan ceiling is $5/month |
| A product returns `no_relevant_reviews_found` | not a failure: ratings exist, nobody wrote text at that star band. Common; it becomes a gap |

**A restart ends a run.** Under hermes a run outlived the cockpit and could be
reconciled on the way back up. It cannot now, so `recover()` marks anything left
`running` as `failed` and says why, rather than leaving a row that never moves
again. Rebuild between runs, not during one.

### Two safety defaults worth knowing

Bound to `127.0.0.1` — with no `MRA_APP_PASSWORD_HASH` set, login is disabled,
and an unauthenticated agent with web access should not be listening on your
LAN. `.env.example` also sets `MRA_COOKIE_SECURE=false`: a browser silently
drops a `Secure` cookie over plain `http://localhost`, so without that, login
would appear to work and then immediately log you back out.

Set a password before this reaches any shared network:

```bash
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint sh mra -c "npm run hashpw"   # -> MRA_APP_PASSWORD_HASH
```

### What the agent can reach

Five functions at most, and nothing else. No shell, no filesystem, no second
agent's memory. `web_search` and `web_fetch` are always there; the three review
tools (`amazon_find_product`, `amazon_reviews`, `trustpilot_reviews`) appear
only when `APIFY_TOKEN` is set, and are **withheld entirely** when it is not —
an agent offered a tool that always throws burns turns rediscovering that.
Every one of them writes to one directory — this run's corpus — and the route
that serves those bytes back sends them as `text/plain` under
`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'`, so a scraped page cannot become a
script on this origin.

That matters more here than in most services: stage 1 reasons over pages fetched
from the open web, which is the textbook setup for prompt injection. The blast
radius is a packet that lies, and the packet is validated.

### Search and page-fetching

Stage 1 is mostly a web-search agent, so what it searches and fetches with
matters. Two pieces, wired in as one container plus one API key:

- **Apify** — the only route to marketplace reviews. Amazon serves this server
  a bot page **at HTTP 200** to every other method tried (plain fetch, headless
  Chrome, Firecrawl in both proxy modes), because the block is on the address.
  Apify runs the scraper on its own addresses. Billed per event against a real
  card with no allowance: ~$0.006 per Amazon review, and the FREE plan stops at
  $5/month. Unset leaves `review_mining` gapped rather than faked. Full
  measurements in `spec-review-mining.md`.
- **SearXNG** — a free, self-hosted metasearch engine, one container
  (`searxng`, ~100 MB), no API key, no per-query cost. It aggregates several
  search engines without handing your queries to any one of them as the
  vendor of record.
- **Firecrawl** — fetches a found page's content, cleaned up for an LLM to
  read. Wired to their **cloud API** (`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, free tier
  available) rather than self-hosted: their own stack is 5+ containers (an
  API, a headless-browser service, Redis, RabbitMQ or FoundationDB, Postgres)
  built from source, not pulled as images — a project of its own, not a
  compose-file addition. Worth doing later if you want zero cloud
  dependency; not done here.

**No manual step required, and no auto-detect to get wrong.** `tools.ts` calls
SearXNG for search and Firecrawl for content, always, by name. The previous
stack had to correct hermes's own backend auto-detect with a one-shot
`hermes-config` container, because with both configured hermes preferred
Firecrawl for search too and silently skipped SearXNG. That whole service is
gone; there is no configuration step left to forget.

`web_fetch` also archives every body it retrieves, hashes it, and hands the
agent back the `sha256:…` id to cite. Under hermes the agent was told to write
those files itself with the terminal tool — a mechanical step on the model's
to-do list, and a model that skipped it produced a packet claiming
`archived: true` over a file that did not exist. The id is now the hash of the
exact bytes on disk, which is what makes
`GET /api/research/runs/:id/sources/:sha` able to re-hash the file and tell you
whether it still matches.

Every behavioural fix here has a regression test; keep that true. Most of them
are about what the validator **refuses**, which is where the value is.

## Deploy

**https://marketing.vanis.ai** — on the same VPS as chat.vanis.ai, sharing
nothing with it but Caddy. `../setup.md` §5a is the full account.

```bash
bash deploy/vps/deploy.sh                          # from the laptop
ssh -t owui bash ~/mra-compose/change-password.sh  # set or change the login
```

`deploy.sh` runs the tests, builds the image **here**, preflights it, and ships
it with `docker save | ssh docker load`. It never builds on the VPS: that box
has ~2.4 GiB free and no swap, and a native compile plus a vite build is enough
to wake the OOM killer — which may well pick agentchat.

What differs from the local stack, all in `deploy/vps/docker-compose.yaml`:

| | Local | VPS |
|---|---|---|
| Reached via | `127.0.0.1:8080` | Caddy, over a dedicated `edge` network |
| Image | built from source | pre-built, `pull_policy: never` |
| Restart | `on-failure` (on-demand) | `unless-stopped` |
| Login | optional | **required** — compose refuses to start with an empty hash |
| Backups | none | nightly, via `mra-snapshot.sh` |

Two decisions worth knowing before you change them:

- **`edge`, not `pa-compose_default`.** That bridge is the one hermes's
  `172.28.0.1:8642` is firewalled open to. Verified after deploy: from `mra`,
  `agentchat` does not resolve and hermes times out.
- **The backup never stops `mra`.** agentchat's half of the nightly job stops
  its container for a consistent copy; doing that here would kill a research
  run every night. `VACUUM INTO` copies the live database consistently instead.

**The deploy starts locked** — the stored hash is of a random password nobody
knows. Nothing works until you run `change-password.sh`.

## What is not built

Stages 2–5, the viability gate, the angle map, the entailment checker, the skill
editor and GRADE mode. The stage rail renders them as `not built` rather than
hiding them, because four fifths greyed out is an accurate picture.
