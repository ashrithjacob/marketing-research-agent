/**
 * The agent's two tools: find pages, and read one.
 *
 * **Superseded:** hermes supplied `web_search` / `web_extract` / a terminal / a
 * browser, and the run depended on which of those the harness happened to have
 * configured — the first live run fell back to driving a browser because `ddgs`
 * was missing on the VPS, and the cockpit showed a run that looked idle while it
 * worked. In-process there is no harness to configure: these two functions are
 * the entire surface the agent has, and they are the same two on every machine.
 *
 * The narrowing is also the security story. Stage 1 reasons over pages fetched
 * from the open web, which is the textbook setup for prompt injection. Neither
 * tool can run a command, read a file, or write anywhere except the corpus
 * directory this run owns, so the worst a poisoned page can do is lie to the
 * packet — and the packet is validated.
